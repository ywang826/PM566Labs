<p><strong>The violin plots reveal distinct regional in wind speed distributions. The northeast region shows Wind speeds are concentrated at lower values (near 0–2.5 m/s)but with a long tail reaching higher speeds (above 10 m/s), while the northwest distribution is wider and flatter, indicating more variation across wind speeds, The southeast exhibits Wind speeds are tightly clustered at very low values (near 0–2.5 m/s). The shape is narrow, showing less variation overall, and the southwest region demonstrates more symmetric and centered, with a slight concentration around 2–3 m/s. Overall, the northeast region appears to have the highest wind speeds, while the southeast region shows the most concentrated distribution around 2.5m/s.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Descripition</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the southeast and southwest, the relationship is strongest, with points concentrated at higher dew points and relative humidity levels close to saturation, indicating consistently moist conditions. The northeast shows a moderate range of dew points with relative humidity values spread more widely, but still following a strong upward trend. The northwest exhibits the broadest variation, including lower dew point values and a flatter regression slope, suggesting that humidity is less tightly coupled with dew point in this region.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The scatter plots show that wind speed remains mostly low (0–3 m/s) across all regions, regardless of dew point. The fitted regression lines are nearly flat, indicating little to no linear association between dew point and wind speed. While the southwest shows slightly more variation, overall the relationship is weak in every region.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Descripition</strong></p>
<p><strong>The bar chart reveals significant differences in weather station distribution across regions and elevation categories. The southeast region has the highest number of stations overall, particularly concentrated at low elevations. The northeast region shows more stations at high elevations compared to other regions, which likely reflects mountainous terrain. The southwest region has a moderate number of stations distributed across both elevation categories, while the northwest region has the fewest total stations overall. This distribution pattern suggests regional variability in topography and monitoring priorities.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Descripition</strong></p>
<p><strong>The southeast shows the highest mean dew point (~21 °C), indicating the most humid conditions, while the northwest has the lowest (~13 °C). For wind speed, the southwest records the highest mean (~3.2 m/s), whereas the northeast and southeast have the lowest (~1.7–1.8 m/s). This highlights clear regional contrasts in both humidity and wind patterns.</strong></p>
